# Everything-Calculator
A Python script that can solve many types of math equations

# Installation

## Linux and OS X

Make sure matplotlib, numpy, and sympy are installed.

```bash
python3 -m pip install matplotlib && python3 -m pip install numpy && python3 -m pip install sympy
```

## Windows

Ensure Python is installed by opening command prompt and typing `py`. If it is installed, you should get an output like:

```
Python 3.9.0 (tags/v3.9.0:9cf6752, Oct  5 2020, 15:34:40) [MSC v.1927 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32                       
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```
Don't worry if the version is not exactly 3.9.0. It has to be at least 3.x.x.

If Python is not installed, download Python [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.0/python-3.9.0-amd64.exe).

Then, install git [here](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.29.2.windows.2/PortableGit-2.29.2.2-64-bit.7z.exe)

Then, install pip.
