## Windows

Ensure Python is installed by opening command prompt and typing `py`. If it is installed, you should get an output like:

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```
Don't worry if the version is not exactly 3.9.0. It has to be at least 3.x.x.

If Python is not installed, download Python [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.0/python-3.9.0-amd64.exe).

Execute this command on Command Prompt:

```cmd
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
```

Then run this command:

```
py get-pip.py
```

After pip is installed, run the following command in cmd: 

```
pip install matplotlib
```
